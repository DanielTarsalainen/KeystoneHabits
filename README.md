### Introduction

KeystoneHabits is a Self-help application for everyone interested in ancient philosophy, reading and meditation. It fetches a quote and image automatically every day and allows a user to search and save books from Google Books. When a book is saved, a user can mark it as read (to place it to the "Finished books" -list), set the current page or delete it. A swipe gesture from left to right marks a book as read and swipe from right to left opens the deletion possibility. "Finished books" -list shows all the books that a user has marked as read, it also allows a user to delete books.

Habits-page lets a user to save meditation and reading -sessions, as well as track their progress on either of the activities. As in the books-section, when a user swipes from right to left, the deletion possibility emerges.
